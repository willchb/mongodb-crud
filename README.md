# mongodb-crud

An easy to use [CRUD] for [MongoDB].

<h2 id="introduction">
  Introduction
</h2>

This package provides methods to [create], [read], [update] and [delete]
documents in a [MongoDB] database.

In short, you [create a connector] and use it to [create a crud] for a specific [database] and [collection]. Then you call any of the four methods of the crud
you created to perform any of the four [CRUD] operations.

<h2 id="create-a-connector">
  Create a connector
</h2>

First thing you need is a connector. A connector is a method that returns a
persistent connection to a [MongoDB] host. The connector is required to
[create a crud].

In order to create a connector, call the `createConnector` method with an
optional options object containing the information to connect, such as: host,
port, etc.

A [connection string] may be set by the property `url` of the options object.
If it's not, `createConnector` still looks it up from the environment variable
`DBURL`. Therefore, if you want to use a [connection string] you should set
either:

  - the `url` property of the options object;

    ```js
    const connector = createConnector({
      url: 'mongodb://user:pass@host:port',
    });
    ```

  - or the environment variable `DBURL`

However, if no [connection string] is provided, `createConnector` creates it
from the following individual parameters: host, port, username and password.
Here's how you could set them:

- **host**: it's `'localhost'`, unless either of the below is provided:

  - a `host` property in the options object:

    ```js
    const connector = createConnector({
      host: 'my-mongodb-host',
    });
    ```

  - an environment variable `DBHOST`

- **port**: by default it's `'27017'`, unless either of the below is provided:
  - a `port` property in the options object:

    ```js
    const connector = createConnector({
      port: '20118',
    });
    ```

  - an environment variable `DBPORT`

- **username**: it's not set nor part of the [connection string] by default. If
  you need username to connect, provide either:

  - a `username` property in the options object:

    ```js
    const connector = createConnector({
      username: 'my-username',
    });
    ```

  - an environment variable `DBUSER`

- **password**: it's not set nor part of the [connection string] by default.
  It's ignored if username isn't given. If you need password to connect,
  provide a username and either:

  - a `password` property in the options object:

    ```js
    const connector = createConnector({
      password: 'my-secret-pass',
    });
    ```

  - an environment variable `DBPASS`


### Getting a persistent connection

If you want a persistent connection for any operation that is not part of the
[CRUD], you can get one by simply calling the connector.

Here's how you'd create a new user in the database:

```js
const { createConnector } = require('mongodb-crud');

const connector = createConnector({ url: 'mongodb://user:pass@host:port' });
const conn = await connector();

await conn.db('admin').addUser('newuser', 's3cr3t');
```

<h2 id="create-a-crud">
  Create a CRUD
</h2>

Once you have a connector, you need to create a crud, which is just a plain
object with these methods: [create], [read], [update], [delete].

A crud only operates on one [collection]. That means you need to create a crud
for each [collection] you want to [create] documents in, [read] documents from,
[update/save] documents to, and [delete] documents from.


```js
const { createConnector, createCRUD } = require('mongodb-crud');

const connector = createConnector({ url: 'mongodb://user:pass@host:port' });

// this crud has methods create, read, update and delete, for operating
// on the 'users' collection of the 'my-app-db' database
const usersCRUD = createCRUD(connector, 'my-app-db', 'users');

// this crud has methods create, read, update and delete, for operating
// on the 'orders' collection of the 'my-app-db' database
const ordersCRUD = createCRUD(connector, 'my-app-db', 'orders');
```

<h2 id="create-a-document">
  Create a document
</h2>

Once you have [a crud] for your [database] and [collection], you just need to
call the method `create` with a plain object representing the document you
want to add to the [collection].

The create operation changes the document by adding an `_id` property to it.
The value of that property is the auto generated `_id` â€” the primary key in
[MongoDB] collections. It also returns that `_id`. The `_id` is an [ObjectId]
that can be converted to a [String] representation via the method `toString`.

```js
// create a document
const document = {
  username: 'john',
  password: 'secret',
  name: 'John Bart',
  email: 'john@example.com',
};
// _id is auto-generated and set to the document by the connector
const _id = await usersCRUD.create(document);
```
